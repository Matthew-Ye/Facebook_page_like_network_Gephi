# Visualization Data of Facebook page like network by Gephi

Gephi is a tool for data visualization and analysis.

In this project, I crawled and analyzed networks of page of BBC news on Facebook connected through the likes between them by Netvizz and Gephi.
Netvizz is a tool that helps analyze different sections of Facebook platform. Here I use its function of page like network to crawl the data. Then I visualize and analyze the network with Gephi.
I chose BBC News as the seed page and retrieved 42 pages with 183 edges.

More details and analysis are in `Facebook page like network.pdf`.
